## 📚 Overview

This repository was developed as part of the **[QAMP (Qiskit Advocate Mentorship Program) 2025](https://github.com/qiskit-advocate/qamp-2025/issues/42)** initiative. The project aims to create a comprehensive set of Jupyter notebooks to help learners prepare for the **Qiskit v2.X certification** exam while serving as a valuable community resource for developers transitioning to the new version.

### Project Goals
- Provide hands-on coding exercises aligned with the official Qiskit certification study guide
- Create accessible learning material for the quantum computing community
- Support candidates preparing for the certification exam with example problems and solutions
- Help onboard developers to Qiskit v2.X with practical, well-documented examples

This repository contains hands-on examples and practical implementations organized into 8 core sections, covering everything from basic quantum operations to advanced OpenQASM programming and quantum primitives.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.9 or higher
- pip package manager
- Git (for cloning the repository)

### Installation

#### Option 1: Using Virtual Environment (Recommended)

Creating a virtual environment ensures isolated dependencies and reproducibility:

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/kibrahim757/qiskit_2x_certification_exam_tutorial.git

# Create a virtual environment
python -m venv qiskit_env

# Activate the virtual environment
# On macOS/Linux:
source qiskit_env/bin/activate
# On Windows:
# qiskit_env\Scripts\activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -r qiskit_2x_certification_exam_tutorial/requirements.txt

# Launch Jupyter Notebook
jupyter notebook
```

#### Option 2: Direct Installation

If you prefer to install packages globally:

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/kibrahim757/qiskit_2x_certification_exam_tutorial.git

# Install dependencies
pip install -r qiskit_2x_certification_exam_tutorial/requirements.txt

# Launch Jupyter Notebook
jupyter notebook
```

### Running the Notebooks

Once Jupyter is running, navigate to any section folder and open the desired notebook. All notebooks are self-contained and can be run cell-by-cell.

## 📖 Learning Path

For optimal learning, follow the sections in order:

1. **Start with Section 1** to build a strong foundation in quantum operations
2. **Progress through Sections 2-4** to master circuit creation and execution
3. **Dive into Sections 5-6** to understand Qiskit's modern primitive-based workflow
4. **Explore Sections 7-8** for advanced topics in result analysis and OpenQASM

## 🔧 Features

- **Environment Management**: Includes `requirements.txt` for easy dependency installation and virtual environment support
- **Offline-Ready**: Most notebooks work without IBM Quantum cloud access, using local simulators
- **Comprehensive Coverage**: Aligned with Qiskit certification exam topics
- **Practical Examples**: Hands-on code demonstrations with detailed explanations
- **PDF Exports**: Select notebooks include PDF versions for easy reference

## 🎯 Use Cases
